# Tic Tac Toe

Test cases ran:
- no input file -> returned error message
- bad input file -> returned error message
- too many arguments -> returned error message
- added blank lines to file -> printed correct board (which means it handled the cases properly)
- added tabs, blank space to file -> printed correct board
- added poorly formatted line to gomoku.txt: "pink stone Q 6 6". It properly ignored it (invalid color), and 
printed all of the other lines correctly.
